### A mind-alternating bit of silliness called 9 Birthdays

The premise goes... you have a birthday each time a planet in our solar system completes an orbit around our sun. The starting points in time of each of their orbits is the day you were born: your birthdate.

Enter your birthdate into 9 Birthdays and it'll tell you when your next birthday, on each planet, is due to fall.

All the code runs locally in the browser with no calls made to a server other than to get the HTML page and the image files it uses.

## Why?

*When you reach thirty years old on Earth, you're only sixteen on Mars*

Conceived when pointing out to a friend that big birthday milestones are all rather arbitrary and you'd be better off thinking about something else.

## Why now?

I've written `9Birthdays` in Java, Objective C, and Python and I wanted a SPA project to try `@elmlang`.

As such, this Elm code may not fully utilitise FP thinking.
